Introduction 

So, Grosmo. What does that even mean?  Well, it doesn’t mean anything but if you mirror it then, “Osmorg”, means care or concern. 

And if you look at it right then it actually sums up our entire project. Amazing right? 

So as stated above we made this project out of concern for all the deaths and horrible stuff that happened in India due to the Covid-19 Pandemic. We intend to create an app that will take care of you, get you medicines, identify your symptoms and the ailments attached to those, all in all, the ultimate healthcare app for all your bodily needs. 

The Covid-19 pandemic has taught India several painful lessons. Out of them the most important is to Protect Nature; invest in global health; ensure a safety for the poor; and enhance global cooperation. We all should learn to become self-dependent. Through our project we want to ensure awareness of health issues which is important for visibility and community. 

    Problem Statement 

In this pandemic era, we came face to face with the truth of the medical facilities in India with no hope of treatment soon, it is supportive care of infected patients and various preventive strategy is going to help us contain the pandemic and I think it should suffice to say that “It is not ideal”, and we, at Project Grosmo, intend to do something about it by connecting people those who need help and those who can help which will save both time and effort. 

    Objectives 

Briefly explaining we have made an app that can do the following: 

Identify a person’s symptoms. 

Give ideal procedure and treatment guidance to the user... 

Order medicine, if need be 

Recommend a Doctor if need be 

Book appointment with doctor if asked for by the user 
GROSMO APP: It will provide various facilities to the user such as Consulting a doctor, a direct link to websites for booking up of vaccines, Medicines and will provide a platform to increase health awareness. A user can login easily and can avail all these facilities easily. 

GROSMO MANAGEMENT SYSTEM: A whole management system using Java (GUI & Database) in which a user can register using username and password and can enter patient details and through these details he/she will get required medical assistance. 

GROSMO ASSISTANCE: One effective method for a better communication is by using chatbots so we have come up with Grosmo Assistance we can provide 24/7 customer support also live chat has a higher customer satisfaction rating than other customer support channels due to its speed and conversational nature. 

 
Importance and Need of your Project 

We believe that, if done right, our project might be able to revolutionize healthcare and healthcare services in India. 

More importantly, it can actually save lives in times of emergency or even sometimes identify problems that a person may not even suspect themselves to be ailing with. 

India is in desperate need of an all-encompassing public healthcare system. The pandemic has shown that India’s healthcare system is lacking on multiple fronts and calls for a rework by all stakeholders. In case of firms, poor health conditions impact physical and mental ability, worker turnover, and attendance, leading to lower productivity. At a macro level, lower economic efficiency results in lower production relative to inputs employed, leading to lower economic growth and reduced income generation. This more deadly phase has stressed out India’s health infrastructure and the improvements made in the last year. 

Medical platforms to determine whether a patient needs to see a doctor, or can be treated at home. This is helping to reduce waiting times - particularly important during COVID-19. 

The advantages of being able to speak to a doctor without leaving home-particularly useful for people with mobility problems-are among the benefits of virtual consultations. 

Some other benefits are it people can donate directly through it in one easy step so there’s a higher chance of multiple and ongoing donations. 

 

 

Study/Project Design: A GUI Java based application and android app from flutter.  

 

Drawbacks and the Limitation: In the initial stages of the project, we cannot influence people in the real world to follow our methods and implement them. In the beginning there can be many issues such as education (teaching the public about your issue or cause) because these days there are lot of misconceptions and it’s very important to clear them before it becomes a rumor, explaining current events (and how to connect with our issue and efforts), and engagement (soliciting a low-level action on behalf of our app and website). But bit by bit we wish to create a change and make a world better place to live and will sustain this Earth for our future generations.  

Project Execution 

Java (Grosmo GUI): The main component of our project Grosmo, is a Java-based GUI made by using the Swing module, in which we have made 7 frames, I.e., Start, login, Signup, Register, Patient Details, About, Assistance, etc. Using all these JFrames we are continuously saving and storing the data in MySql(JDBC connection of java) with the help of the XAMPP server and PHP admin. The main idea was to use that data accordingly to show output using Machine Learning. 

Java (Live Chat using Socket): For assistance and live support to our users and patients as in the health care industry live assistance and live support is very crucial, and to solve the issue we have made the live server for the same where users can chat with our team members on the server to talk, help, issue or anything. It’s the live chat in real-time made using the Socket module in Java. 

Flutter (App): The idea behind making an app of Grosmo is to migrate grosmo to mobile users also, as we know mobile usage is very high and for better availability of our project and access, we have made the app where almost the same features of GUI has been initiated and even there, we are also showing some outputs such as BMI, and health status of the registered patient. 


Results and discussion 

In today’s world, everyone is struggling to prioritize their health in their busy lives. Now it has become the fact that more and more people increasingly rely on technology to take care of themselves and meet their health goals. Adoption of modern technology in the form of healthcare apps is truly a win-win condition for both healthcare providers and patients. 

As, by passing our knowledge will increase and as will our project features and working will increase. Optimizing it with upgrades and nourishing our app more and more will   

We hope to have huge number of users so that we can add more functionalities relevant to our requirements. The future of healthcare is being driven by developments in mobile technology. By 2020, the CAGR of the mobile health industry is expected to be around 41%. With more demand for efficient, user-friendly, and secure medical applications, it is now the right time to invest our resources in health app development and create future-forward solutions. 

If we talk about component used in our project it is java 75% next is Dart which is 20% and from which our android app is made. At last, there is usage of HTML which is just 5%. 

 
Conclusion and Future Work 

1)Links and Resources available for creating awareness among the general public. 

2) An Android app made by Flutter which comprises and depicts the android version of our Grosmo. 

3) Website component of our Project Grosmo has been also started which will demonstrate whole features in a creative way. 

4)A chat bot for provide 24/7 customer support and for the ease up of communication in an advance way. 

5) Easy way for the public to know about issues and a BMI calculator for tracking down their health status. 

6) Securing a Healthy Future for the generations to come. 

For Future Work we are planning to add speech recognition using AI to our chat bot which will do speech recognition and will allow the machine to catch the words, phrases, and sentences we speak. Secondly, it will do natural language processing i.e., allows the machine to understand what we speak. At last, speech synthesis will allow the machine to speak. 

We are also planning to deploy to an application server that is making an application available to end-users. Our application will be running in the application server which uses a database to retrieve some data.
